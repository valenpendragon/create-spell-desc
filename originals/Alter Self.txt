Alter Self
2nd-level (transmutation; arcane, movement,
shapechanging, weaponry)
Classes: Sorcerer, wizard
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Self
Components: V, S
Duration: Concentration (1 hour)
You use magic to mold yourself into a new form.
Choose one of the options below. Until the spell ends,
you can use an action to choose a different option.
Amphibian: Your body takes on aquatic adaptations.
You can breathe underwater normally
and gain a swimming speed equal to your
base Speed.
Altered State: You decide what you look like.
None of your gameplay statistics change but you
can alter anything about your body’s appearance,
including but not limited to: your heritage, 1 foot
of height, weight, clothing, tattoos, piercings,
facial features, sound of your voice, hair style
and length, skin and eye coloration, sex, and
any other distinguishing features. You cannot
become a creature of a different size category,
and your limb structure remains the same;
for example if you’re bipedal, you can’t use
this spell to become a quadruped. Until the
spell ends, you can use an action to change
your appearance.
Red in Tooth and Claw: You grow magical
natural weapons of your choice with a +1
bonus to attack and damage. Your unarmed
strikes deal 1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or
slashing damage of a type determined by
the natural weapon you chose; for example
a tentacle deals bludgeoning, a horn deals
piercing, and claws deal slashing.
Cast at Higher Levels. When using a spell slot of
5th-level, add the following to the list of forms you
can adopt.
Greater Natural Weapons. The damage dealt
by your natural weapon increases to 2d6, and
you gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls
with your natural weapons.
Mask of the Grave. You adopt the appearance
of a skeleton or zombie (your choice). Your type
changes to undead, and mindless undead creatures
ignore your presence, treating you as one
of their own. You don’t need to breathe and
you become immune to poison.
Wings. A pair of wings sprouts from your
back. The wings can appear bird-like, leathery
like a bat or dragon’s wings, or like the wings
of an insect. You gain a fly speed equal to your
base Speed.
