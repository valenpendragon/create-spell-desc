Protection from Poison
2nd-level (abjuration; divine, nature, negation,
protection)
Classes: Druid, herald
Casting Time: 1 action
Range: Touch
Target: One creature
Components: V, S
Duration: 1 hour
The target has advantage on saving throws against
being poisoned and resistance to poison damage.
Additionally, if the target is poisoned, you negate
one poison affecting it. If more than one poison
affects the target, you negate one poison you know
is present (otherwise you negate one at random).
