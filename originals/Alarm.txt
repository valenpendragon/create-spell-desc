You set an alarm against unwanted intrusion that
alerts you whenever a creature of size Tiny or larger
touches or enters the warded area. When you cast
the spell, choose any number of creatures. These
creatures don’t set off the alarm.
Choose whether the alarm is silent or audible. The
silent alarm is heard in your mind if you are within
1 mile of the warded area and it awakens you if you
are sleeping. An audible alarm produces a loud noise
of your choosing for 10 seconds within 60 feet.
Cast at Higher Levels. You may create an additional
alarm for each slot level above 1st. The spell’s
range increases to 600 feet, but you must be familiar
with the locations you ward, and all alarms must be
set within the same physical structure. Setting off
one alarm does not activate the other alarms.
You may choose one of the following effects in
place of creating an additional alarm. The effects
apply to all alarms created during the spell’s casting.
Increased Duration. The spell’s duration
increases to 24 hours.
Improved Audible Alarm. The audible alarm
produces any sound you choose and can be
heard up to 300 feet away.
Improved Mental Alarm. The mental alarm
alerts you regardless of your location, even if
you and the alarm are on different planes of
existence.
